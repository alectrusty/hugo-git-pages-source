### About

Hello World! My name is Alec Trusty. I'm a geographic data analyst with over three years experience in
GIS and data analysis in a wide variety of applications, with an emphasis on open source software, reproducibility,
and automation. I currently work for
[NV5 Geospatial](https://www.nv5.com/services/geospatial-technology/) supporting development of projects ranging from
LiDar derived hydrography, forestry biometric analysis, and residential water use mapping. Previously I worked as an independent
contractor for [Urban Design 4 Health](http://urbandesign4health.com/) and UBC's [Health & Community Design Lab](https://health-design.spph.ubc.ca/tools/walkability-index/),
as well as a research analyst at the [Sustaining Urban Places Research Lab](https://www.suprlab.org/). If you'd like to connect,
